Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that computers use to communicate over the internet. 
It is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks
TCP establishes a connection between a sender and receiver before data can be sent. 
Data sent using a TCP protocol is guaranteed to be delivered to the receiver. If data is lost in transit it will recover the data and resend it.

TCP is best suited to be used for applications :-
Secure Shell (SSH)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

Email (SMTP)

In this,we are going to create two python file
One is client file i.e. tcpclient.py and second is server file i.e. tcpserver.py
tcpclient file first connect with tcpserver which is receiving point and then tcpclient will send the data(message) to the receiver.
The receiver then send back the data in hash format to the client.
